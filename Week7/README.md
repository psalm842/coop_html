# Week 7 - Publishing You Website

## How to Publish a Website

So you've made a website and you like it. You want others to see your awesome website. How do you do it? 

You need a **hosting service**.

A **hosting service** will store your website on a server somewhere in the world (actually in many cases it stores your website on many servers all over the world so that it can be accessed quickly from anywhere). 

It will also allow you to assign a **domain name** to your website (e.g. www.mywebsite.com). 

In our case we are going to use hosting service name netlify, which specifically hosts **static websites**

The type of websites we have focused on in this class are called static websites. That is, websites whose files don't change. Even though the website might be dynamic (or interactive), the underlying javascript files are static (do not change).

Creating a dynamic site is a much more complex task and might be a good topic for another class.
